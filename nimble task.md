A general hub note for specific nimble tasks and things relating to them.

Nimble tasks are basically small scripts written in [nimscript](nimscript) that you can execute from the terminal `nimble <name of task>` as long as your current working directory is the folder containing the `<project>.nimble` file. 

These nimble tasks can be executed by any nim-package-manager that implements their execution, such as [nymph](nymph), [nimble](nimble) or [atlas](atlas).
