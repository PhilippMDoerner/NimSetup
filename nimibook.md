A tool for writing more guided documentation for projects written in nim.
Very useful as it can compile the code-examples and thus validate that they always work.

If you already have docs in markdown somewhere, you can still integrate nimibook as it can import markdown files as well.

Examples of nimibooks in the wild:
- [norm](https://norm.nim.town/index.html)
- [Owlkettle](https://can-lehmann.github.io/owlkettle/README.html)
- [Snorlogue](https://philippmdoerner.github.io/Snorlogue/bookCompiled/)
