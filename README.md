# NimSetup
A list of guides for various things related to nim projects, their setup, maintenance and more

These are individual guides written together from my personal Obsidian docs.

Note: Not all files linked here are actually present.
Some .md files will not be missing as they have very little relevance or actual information (such as `nim.md`). Anything with relevant content behind it will be present in this repo.

## Guide-List:
- [How to set up a nim project on github](./Github%20Project%20Setup.md)
- [How to update a nim package version](./Github%20Project%20Maintenance.md)
