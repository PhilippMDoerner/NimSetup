General Hub note for things relating to specifically nim documentation

For reference documenation, write doc-comments.
There you can use [runnable examples](Runnable-Examples.md) to provide demonstration of using a modules public-api.
You can also [link within doc comments](Nim%20Doc%20Linking.md) to other procs/symbols that you have when your doc comments mention them.

A good tool to write more guided documentation with examples etc. is [nimibook](nimibook.md).
